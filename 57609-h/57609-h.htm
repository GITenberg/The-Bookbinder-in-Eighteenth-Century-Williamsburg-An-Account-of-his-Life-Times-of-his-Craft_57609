<p>In October 1770 the inventory of the personal
estate of Lord Botetourt, His Majesty&rsquo;s
Governor General of Virginia, contained a
catalogue of books in the library at the
Palace, made after his death by his executors.
The shelves held over three hundred volumes. Today this
library has been recreated by Colonial Williamsburg using
the inventory list and other information on books in print
at that time. The actual library of Lord Botetourt was
sent back to England&mdash;and was lost at sea.</p>
<p>Much about the Governor can be deduced from the
books he owned&mdash;plus a few he had borrowed and neglected
to return. His interests ranged over the whole field of
human knowledge, with particular emphasis on history,
literature, law, and politics. However, it is not with the
substance but with the form of these volumes in the renewed
library that we are concerned. For us the important fact
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
is that, with a few exceptions, they are eighteenth-century
books <i>in eighteenth-century bindings</i>.</p>
<p>The visitor who pauses only for a moment to look at them
will see that most of them share certain outward characteristics:</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="Bound book." width="324" height="500" />
</div>
<blockquote>
<p class="revint">They are bound in leather, with
brown calfskin predominant;</p>
<p class="revint">Their spines are crossed by a number
of horizontal ridges;</p>
<p class="revint">The title (abbreviated) usually appears
in gold leaf on a small panel
of colored leather glued to the
spine, and sometimes the author&rsquo;s
name, too;</p>
<p class="revint">The spine may also bear a moderate
amount of decorative gold tooling;
and</p>
<p class="revint">The sides of the volumes, where
visible, are likely to display &ldquo;blind&rdquo; tooling, which
means ornamental indentations in the surface of the
leather, made without gold leaf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the five most noticeable characteristics of books
bound in the eighteenth century in England or in England&rsquo;s
North American colonies. Standards of workmanship were
on the whole higher in the mother country, but binders on
both sides of the Atlantic used the same basic methods of
bookmaking.</p>
<p>The techniques of bookbinding, in fact, had not changed
much for a very long time. Men like William Parks, John
Stretch, and Thomas Brend bound books in eighteenth-century
Williamsburg in essentially the same way as had
their predecessors in medieval monasteries a thousand years
before.</p>
<p>Incidentally, among bookbinding craftsmen one does not
mention &ldquo;machine binding&rdquo;; to the true binder there is no
true binding <i>except</i> by hand. The machines of a modern
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
bindery do not &ldquo;bind&rdquo; a book according to the craft tradition,
but &ldquo;case&rdquo; it. Therefore, the words &ldquo;bind,&rdquo; &ldquo;bookbinding,&rdquo;
&ldquo;bound books,&rdquo; and so on whenever used in this
pamphlet always refer to the traditional hand operation,
never to the machine process or product. And &ldquo;bookbinder&rdquo;
herein is always the hand craftsman, never the machine
operator.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>AN ANCIENT &ldquo;ART AND MYSTERY&rdquo;</i></span></h2>
<p>Man learned to write long before he learned to make
paper. Smooth stones, clay tiles, and wax tablets, among
other surfaces, were early precursors of scratch-pads and
typewriter bond. Later, but before the modern form of
a paged book developed, written records were most often
kept on long rolls of papyrus, parchment, or vellum&mdash;the
latter two being much alike.</p>
<p>The lines of writing sometimes ran the entire length of
these rolls, sometimes they ran crossways, and sometimes
they paralleled the long edge but were divided into columns.
The third arrangement is still used in Jewish scrolls of the
law, which are kept on rollers, one at each end.</p>
<p>Such a long strip could, however, be folded accordion-like
instead of being rolled up. If the folds were made between
the columns of writing, each column became a page and the
whole began to resemble the book we are familiar with today.</p>
<p>At first these rudimentary books were protected by
wooden boards pasted to the first and last pages. As a
next step holes were stabbed through every page near the
left-hand fold, and a cord or thong laced through the holes
held the &ldquo;accordion&rdquo; together along one side.</p>
<p>By the fifth century a method had come into general use
of sewing individually folded sheets together one by one,
not to each other but to a series of flexible &ldquo;hinges.&rdquo; These
were usually narrow strips of leather&mdash;four, five, or sometimes
six depending on the height of the book&mdash;laid across
the folded edges of the pages. Linen thread sewed through
the folds and around each cross-strip in turn held the pages
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
firmly in place. Wooden boards affixed to the thongs as
well as pasted to the first and last pages protected the whole,
sometimes with the help of metal clasps and even locks.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="313" />
<p class="pcap"><i>These methods of preserving written material have now largely been superseded
by the printed and bound or machine-cased book: (A) Diptych or hinged tablet of
wood, ivory, or the like, often carved, whose inner surfaces of wax carried writing
impressed by the stylus. (B) Scroll with columnar writing on a pair of rollers.
(C) Japanese &ldquo;orihon,&rdquo; accordion-folded and bound along one side. (D) Codex or
early form of book, an illuminated manuscript protected between thin boards; our
word &ldquo;book&rdquo; comes from the German for beech <span class="f">(Buch)</span>, a wood often used for this
purpose.</i></p>
</div>
<p>To guard the leather crossbands and linen thread from
exposure and wear, it then became customary to cover the
spine of the book with a wide, vertical strip of leather.
Later, for better appearance and greater protection, the
leather covering was extended partway onto the boards
(the so-called &ldquo;half-binding&rdquo; of the medieval period) and
then all the way.</p>
<p>Thus was developed and perfected the bound book: a
collection of folded sheets sewn together flexibly and protected
between covers. Its physical structure was largely
the creation of monastic craftsmen of the early Middle
Ages, just as its literary content throughout that period
was most often religious scripture or comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>BOOKS CAN BE BEAUTIFUL</i></span></h2>
<p>Speaking only of quality of materials and workmanship,
a book may be bound just as well in a simple cover as in an
ornate one. Fine binding does not require adornment. It
does require the services of a man of high skill and matching
integrity, whose handiwork will inevitably display the quiet
beauties of intrinsic quality.</p>
<p>But in the hands of men who possess the spark of creative
artistry, bookbinding can be more than pure craft work.
Although the binder&rsquo;s decorative tools are forever prefixed,
each to reproduce its own set and simple pattern, they are
infinitely flexible in the ways they can be combined. It is
not the tool that makes a binding beautiful or ugly, but
the hand that holds the tool&mdash;and even more the mind and
eye that guide the hand. The history of bookbinding is
studded with the names of men who were true artists in
leather. For them the most rewarding commission a customer
could give was a simple order to dress some work of
lasting worth in a binding of appropriate beauty.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages all books were rare and valuable.
Each volume was entirely lettered by hand and its pages
were customarily &ldquo;illuminated&rdquo; with elaborately drawn
initial letters and gilded marginal decorations. The binding
of such a book was likely to be as painstakingly ornate as
were its pages, and a few bindings were quite valuable in
themselves. Before full leather covers became standard,
the boards of some manuscript volumes&mdash;especially for a
church altar or a royal library&mdash;might even be encased in
beaten gold or silver and encrusted with enamel and semiprecious
stones.</p>
<p>The invention of printing from type, as everyone knows,
had extremely far-reaching consequences on the spread of
public education and enlightenment. It had also some
effects that were not so desirable. In the didactic phrase
of the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, &ldquo;Printing brought small
books, cheap books, ugly books.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Now it cannot be denied that most books today are
smaller than the great manuscript tomes of the monastic
scholars. They are cheaper, too. But it would be wrong
to say that all books bound since Johann Gutenberg&rsquo;s day
have been ugly. To be sure, introduction of the printing
press increased the flow of work to the bindery. But if the
binder could no longer lavish time and care on every volume,
he could still devote high artistry to an occasional book,
steady craftsmanship to all.</p>
<p>Innumerable examples from the hands of many binders
since the fifteenth century attest that the cover of a printed
book can be as beautiful as that of a manuscript book.
The names of Nicholas Eve, Clovis Eve, &ldquo;Le Gascon&rdquo;
(otherwise unknown), and Geoffrey Tory of sixteenth-century
France, and Padeloup and Le Monnier in the
eighteenth century, deserve mention. In England bindings
are not as easily identified with their binders, but the names
of Thomas Berthelet, royal binder to Henry VIII, and
above all Samuel Mearne, binder to Charles II, stand out.
Roger Payne was England&rsquo;s most distinguished binder in
the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Before the fifteenth century, European binders usually
had worked ornamentation into leather &ldquo;in blind,&rdquo; that is,
without gold leaf. The technique of applying gold seems
to have been perfected by Islamic leatherworkers of Mediterranean
Africa, and brought from Morocco to Europe via
Spain and Italy. Sixteenth-century French binders carried
this kind of adornment to a peak of intricate tooling and
lavish gilding. Their English counterparts, while they
imitated the French, tended to favor simpler designs and
less gold leaf. In the late seventeenth century and continuing
through the eighteenth, straight lines rather than
curves became characteristic of English work.</p>
<p>For example, the broken lines of the &ldquo;cottage&rdquo; style
credited to Samuel Mearne resembled an outlined roof and
walls. Later the &ldquo;Cambridge&rdquo; style became popular in
England. It consisted of a vertical panel of thin lines
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
(fillets) on the sides of the book, with flower or leaf ornaments
(fleurons) at the corners and perhaps in the center,
and a narrow lace border around the boards. The example
illustrated indicates that colonial binders continued to
favor the Cambridge design until well into the eighteenth
century.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="515" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Left, &ldquo;cottage&rdquo; style decoration on a 1674 Bible, bound in the shop of Samuel
Mearne of London. Right, &ldquo;Cambridge&rdquo; style binding on a copy of <span class="f">Muscipula</span>
printed in 1728 by William Parks in Annapolis and bound by him.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Around 1760 a Dutch binder developed a method of
treating leather with acid to give it a marbled appearance,
and other binders lost no time in prying the secret away
from him. First among binders in England to learn the
technique was an &eacute;migr&eacute; German, John Baumgarten, who
made the most of his advantage. As Thomas Jefferson
wrote to Robert Skipwith in 1771, books &ldquo;bound by Bumgarden
in fine Marbled bindings&rdquo; cost 50 per cent more
than in plain bindings.</p>
<p>In addition to national styles and local designs that
developed at various times and places, certain binders
perfected individual patterns of their own. In some cases
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
these were so unique as to be almost certain evidence that
a book so decorated was bound by the man in question.
But not always. As in the case of Samuel Mearne, work
identified with the master might actually have been done
under his instruction by a journeyman in his shop.</p>
<p>Among the very large number of eighteenth-century
bindings that survive, the great difficulty is to identify with
any certainty the binder of a particular volume. In many
instances&mdash;perhaps most&mdash;it is impossible to be absolutely
sure on this point. Except in France, binders of the eighteenth
century, or any period, who signed or labeled their
work were relatively rare.</p>
<p>One English craftsman who did identify his products
was Roger Payne of London. An eccentric and a heavy
drinker, Payne was nevertheless a careful worker and a
creative artist in the bindery. His books are beautifully
adorned with patterns built up with small tools that he
designed and cut himself. In many of the books he bound,
Payne included a detailed account of his work. The
following statement, copied in part from a Bible now owned
by Princeton University, is a good example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Letter&rsquo;d in ye most exact manner, exceeding rich small
Tool Gilt Back of a new pattern studded in Compartments.
The outside finished in the Richest &amp; most
elegant Taste Richer, &amp; more exact than any Book
that I ever Bound. The insides finished in a new
design exceeding elegant. Bound in the very best
manner sew&rsquo;d with silk on strong and neat Bands.
The Back lined with Russia Leather under the Blue
morrocco. Cover very strong &amp; neat Boards....</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>TELLTALE TOOLS</i></span></h2>
<p>Although some colonial binders labeled their products,
none of the several Williamsburg bookbinders of colonial
days followed Roger Payne&rsquo;s admirable precedent. Examples
of the work of some of them, however, have been
identified beyond doubt through direct or circumstantial
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
evidence&mdash;the latter often derived by processes resembling
police detection.</p>
<p>Clues to the identity of a binder may be found in various
facets of printing and binding: shop records of orders
filled, materials used, and wages paid; place and date of
publication as given on title pages; watermarks in the
paper; and recurrent decorative patterns. Even contemporary
newspaper advertisements may throw light on the
matter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="483" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The watermark of paper made in William Park&rsquo;s paper mill near Williamsburg. It
represents the coat of arms of the Virginia colony. This tracing is taken from
Rutherford Goodwin, <span class="f">The William Parks Paper Mill at Williamsburg</span> (Lexington,
Va., 1939), in which he tells how the watermark was once described by a New
Englander as resembling two men in long underwear with a basket of fish between
them. The parallel vertical lines are the &ldquo;chain lines&rdquo; characteristic of handmade
&ldquo;laid&rdquo; paper.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Evidence of every kind has been used in tracing out
the story of the bookbinding craft in Williamsburg. The
surest clues, especially in tracking down and identifying
individual bindings, have been the distinctive footprints
left by the binders&rsquo; decorating tools. Archaeological excavations
on the site of the Printing Office have yielded
examples of these tools, some for stamping letters and
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
others for impressing the gilded decoration that made the
eighteenth-century bookbinder&rsquo;s products as attractive as
they were useful.</p>
<p>Under the eye of microscope and enlarging camera even
mass-produced typewriters reveal slight irregularities that
are unique to each machine. The brass stamps and rolls
used by eighteenth-century binders for working decorations
into leather were all made by hand. Because of some imperfection
in workmanship or simply because ornamental dies
were not supposed to duplicate each other, each tool had
its own peculiarities. Very often the distinguishing characteristics
of the impressions they made are visible to the
naked eye.</p>
<p>Two such telltale tools&mdash;both &ldquo;rolls&rdquo; or wheel-like tools
used to make continuous border patterns&mdash;proved especially
useful in tracing the history of Williamsburg bookbinders
and bindings. The trail of one can be followed through the
ownership of successive binders for nearly three-quarters
of a century. Another shows up again and again throughout
a fifty-year period. Similar clues left by other tools were
also helpful in the detective process, but cannot be dealt
with in this brief account.</p>
<p>For convenience we shall call the two chief telltales the
&ldquo;Mousetrap&rdquo; roll and the &ldquo;egg&rdquo; roll. They serve almost
as indexes to the rest of our story. The impressions made
by the original tools, and the &ldquo;smoke imprint&rdquo; made by
modern recuttings of the same tools, are shown in the
accompanying illustration.</p>
<p>The Mousetrap roll owes its name to the publication on
which it made its first known appearance, a Latin poem
entitled <i>Muscipula</i>, which means &ldquo;mousetrap.&rdquo; Its pattern,
alternating two rather conventional motifs, is not particularly
noteworthy in appearance. Nevertheless, the
impression it made was not duplicated by any other roll.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="637" />
<p class="pcap"><i>This representation of a book cover shows one of the chief clues followed in
tracing the tools used and books bound by Williamsburg binders. It shows the design
on a copy of the <span class="f">Statutes and Charter of the College of William and Mary</span>
printed in Williamsburg in 1736 by William Parks and bound in his shop. The
College itself is in Williamsburg, of course, but this volume is in the John Carter
Brown Library at Providence, Rhode Island, and another like it in design is in the
Bodleian Library, Oxford, England. The illustration was made (except for the
magnification) as a smoke imprint of twentieth-century tools cut in the same pattern
as the originals. The inner panel of the Cambridge style decoration was made
by the &ldquo;Mousetrap&rdquo; roll that Parks brought with him from Annapolis. The intermediate
rectangle, made by the &ldquo;egg&rdquo; roll, reveals the elongated oval that reappeared
on other books connected with Parks and his successors in the Williamsburg
printing offices. The corner fleuron also appeared on earlier Parks bindings.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The egg roll is no more unusual as a pattern, but gains
distinction from the fact that its built-in signature is an
obvious mistake. It also alternates two conventional
motifs, a Maltese cross and a pointed oval or &ldquo;egg.&rdquo; Perhaps
by looking at the detail of the illustration you can see
why this tool identifies itself every time it appears on a
binding. Apparently the engraver who made the original
roll erred in calculating its circumference and came out
uneven with his pattern. So he simply made the final oval
longer than the others.</p>
<p>Once seen, the flaw jumps to the eye from every binding
on which it appears and might seem to offer clear proof that
all such bindings done within the same period were the
work of one man. But even the best circumstantial evidence
falls short of perfection. Although we can say, for instance,
that such-and-such bindings came from the shop of William
Parks, we cannot always say that he himself did the work.</p>
<p>At one time Parks appears to have employed as many as
eight or nine helpers in his printing office and nearby paper
mill. Very probably one or more of them was specifically
hired to handle the binding end of the business, just as
William Hunter later employed John Stretch to do both
bookbinding and bookkeeping.</p>
<p>However, like Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia, William
Bradford in New York, and James Franklin in Boston,
Parks was doubtless quite capable of binding a book as
well as printing it. Eighteenth-century craftsmen of every
sort customarily doubled in related crafts: the silversmith
was likely to be a jeweler, too, and the cabinetmaker also
a house-joiner. Printing and binding have always been
complementary processes, and nearly every colonial printer
could, if necessary, bind the product of his press.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>EARLY IMPRESSIONS</i></span></h2>
<p>A great many colonial printers also published weekly
newspapers, in whose columns they advertised the job-printing
services and stationery wares they had to offer.
The colophon of the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> of October 1, 1736,
for instance, specified that it was printed in Williamsburg
&ldquo;by W. PARKS. By whom Subscriptions are taken for
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
this Paper, at 15 <i>s. per Annum</i>: and BOOK-BINDING is
done reasonably, in the best Manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first successful printer in Virginia, Parks had been
public printer to the colony of Maryland before he moved to
Williamsburg in 1730. One of the early publications issued
by his Annapolis shop, in 1728, was the aforementioned book
of Latin verse, and the three surviving copies are all decorated
in the same Cambridge pattern and all with the roll
we have named the Mousetrap roll.</p>
<p><i>The Complete Mariner</i>, a manuscript volume of navigational
exercises with a title page printed in Williamsburg
in 1731, was doubtless one of the first products of Parks&rsquo;s
shop in Williamsburg. Its cover was handsomely decorated
in blind with the Mousetrap roll and with two other ornaments
that also were used on books issued by Parks&rsquo;s
Annapolis shop and later on bindings done in Williamsburg.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="332" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Rolls and small stamps used in the Williamsburg bindery. The gap in the outer
edge of the fillet roll permits the binder to start and stop his impression cleanly.
Both rolls and stamps must be heated for use and pressed into the leather quite
hard.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In 1736 Parks published the <i>Charter and Statutes of the</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
<i>College of William and Mary, in Virginia</i>. Three copies
survive in their original bindings. Two of these&mdash;one in
England, one in America&mdash;bear the marks of both the
Mousetrap roll and the egg roll in the simple pattern
illustrated on <a href="#Page_11">page 11</a>. The third is more elaborately
decorated, with many small impressions of other tools, but
around the edge is the telltale egg roll.</p>
<p>Many of the same tools used on this third copy of the
William and Mary Charter, including the egg roll around
the border, reappear on one copy of a book printed nearly
a decade later in New York. This was Daniel Horsmanden&rsquo;s
account of a Negro conspiracy to burn New York
City. The copy in question, now in the Library of Congress,
bears the brief title <i>New York Conspiracy</i> on its spine. The
magnificent library of William Byrd III at Westover
plantation included a book listed under the same abbreviated
title. Daniel Horsmanden was a cousin of Byrd&rsquo;s.
Could the Library of Congress volume have been bound
for Byrd at the Williamsburg shop of William Parks? The
similarities in tooling&mdash;including use of the unmistakeable
egg roll&mdash;would seem to prove it.</p>
<p>Another link in the chain of clues appears on the cover of
a manuscript volume probably written and bound at about
the same time. This was a catalogue of Byrd&rsquo;s library made
by John Stretch, presumably bound by him, and decorated
with the egg roll and one other tool known from earlier
Williamsburg bindings.</p>
<p>Stretch may have worked for Parks before the latter&rsquo;s
death in 1750. He was in the employ of Parks&rsquo;s successor,
William Hunter, for a number of years. Presumably he
bound the books that issued from Hunter&rsquo;s press during
this period as well as the blank record books that were a
staple item of Hunter&rsquo;s business. One of these blank books
was used by George Washington for copies of his letters
and invoices from 1755 to 1765&mdash;and it, too, was decorated
with the egg roll.</p>
<p>One of the few printed books known to have come from
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Hunter&rsquo;s shop was a new edition of the William and Mary
Charter, printed in 1758. One copy that survives in original
covers has another roll also used on the Washington letter
book and small ornaments used on both the earlier edition
of the Charter and on the <i>New York Conspiracy</i>, plus design
similarities to both of these and to the Stretch catalogue of
Byrd&rsquo;s library.</p>
<p>A daybook kept by William Hunter during the first two
years of his proprietorship of the shop carries the trail a
bit farther. A daybook was simply a running record of
each day&rsquo;s transactions of all kinds, more often called a
&ldquo;journal&rdquo; nowadays. It would certainly have been bound
right in the shop, and this daybook bears the impress of a
stamp previously identified with Parks&rsquo;s Annapolis and
earliest Williamsburg imprints.</p>
<p>Another daybook of the Williamsburg printing office also
survives in original binding. It dates from the time of
Hunter&rsquo;s successor, Joseph Royle, and almost beyond
question was also bound in the shop where it was used.
Its cover, not surprisingly, was tooled in blind with two of the
familiar rolls, including the egg roll. A volume of York
County records also survives from the period of Royle&rsquo;s
proprietorship. Its cover shows the impressions of three
old standbys: the egg, the Mousetrap, and a third roll
seen on earlier Williamsburg bindings.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>THE BINDING BUSINESS</i></span></h2>
<p>If the outside covers of two printing office daybooks can
add a few bits to our story, the inside pages should be a
gold mine of information about bookbinding in colonial
Williamsburg. And so they are.</p>
<p>Hunter&rsquo;s daybook for the period from July 1750 through
June 1752 and Royle&rsquo;s covering most of 1764 and all of
1765 tell a great deal about the quantity and variety of
binding work they did, the prices they charged, and a little
about the wages they paid. Hunter, for example, at the
end of 1751 entered payment of 38 pounds 15 shillings
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
against the bookbinding account &ldquo;To John Stretch For his
Wages from the 14th of January to this Day.&rdquo; Thus, from
this source, Stretch earned 15 shillings sixpence a week.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="258" />
<p class="pcap"><i>A part of a page from William Hunter&rsquo;s daybook for the Williamsburg Printing
Office, especially redrawn for this booklet. Notice the entry for bookbinding wages
paid to John Stretch.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The kinds of bookbinding done in the shops of Hunter
and Royle&mdash;and doubtless also by the other Williamsburg
printers, about whose business we lack detailed information&mdash;can
be divided into three main groups: edition binding,
custom binding, and the manufacture of blank record
books. As a sideline, they also made and sold pocketbooks,
letter cases, and other kinds of pocket cases.</p>
<p>In volume of work done in Hunter&rsquo;s shop, and probably
in many other colonial binderies, the manufacture and sale
of blank books was easily of first importance. Obviously
these were not printed books&mdash;although the pages of some
of them were ruled by hand in advance of binding. They
were letter-copy books, account books, and record books
of various kinds used by everyone who was at all systematic
about his business affairs.</p>
<p>Accounts kept &ldquo;after the Italian manner,&rdquo; as described
in John Mair&rsquo;s <i>Book Keeping Methodiz&rsquo;d</i> (about 1750),
called for ten different books. The three chief ones were a
&ldquo;wastebook&rdquo; in which transactions were jotted down at
the time they took place, a permanent &ldquo;journal&rdquo; or &ldquo;daybook&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
into which they were transcribed in a more stately
hand when time permitted, and a &ldquo;ledger&rdquo; containing in
final and complete form all accounts pertaining to the
business. Subsidiary records described by Mair were the
cash book, book of charges and merchandise, book of house
expenses, factory or invoice book, sales book, bill book, and
receipt book.</p>
<p>Hunter&rsquo;s daybook shows entries covering sales of all the
principal varieties and many of the subsidiary forms. In
fact, entries pertaining to &ldquo;blank books,&rdquo; &ldquo;legers,&rdquo; &ldquo;alphabets,&rdquo;
&ldquo;journals,&rdquo; &ldquo;account books,&rdquo; &ldquo;day books,&rdquo; &ldquo;waste-books,&rdquo;
and the like far outnumber all other binding entries
together. Royle&rsquo;s daybook, which seems to have been kept
on a somewhat different basis&mdash;perhaps less meticulously&mdash;than
Hunter&rsquo;s, lists proportionately fewer such entries compared
to those for binding printed volumes.</p>
<p>One might expect that business record books would have
been bound sturdily, but in plain and cheap dress. Sometimes
they were, but often they were just as well finished
as were printed books, usually in good quality calfskin,
sometimes in vellum or parchment. Ledgers in particular
were large and heavy books; since they got steady usage,
they needed to be made of the best materials and workmanship
for the sake of durability. And custom usually
led to a certain amount of decoration on even the most
utilitarian volume. The result was that blank books were
often as fine in outward appearance as those from the
press&mdash;and sometimes more costly, because of the larger
skins needed to cover them.</p>
<p>Not a few of the books sold by William Hunter and
presumed to have been made up by him or John Stretch
brought a price of a pound or more. This was, as we have
seen, a good deal more than Stretch earned in a week.
The most imposing price charged to any of Hunter&rsquo;s
customers was the 3 pounds 10 shillings John Hall paid
for &ldquo;a large Record Book Imperial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eighteenth-century paper was manufactured by hand,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
and sheets of various sizes and kinds bore such designations
as pot, foolscap, pro patria, crown, demy, royal, super
royal, imperial, atlas, and elephant. These names referred
to supposedly standard sizes, but actual dimensions were
neither precise nor unchanging. In seventeenth-century
England a sheet of &ldquo;demy&rdquo; measured about 10 by 15&frac12;
inches. The English paper of the same name today is
17&frac12; by 22&frac12; inches.</p>
<p>This increase in dimensions of paper took place gradually,
and as the size of sheets grew the size of pages could also
grow. A result was that folio books became too large to be
handy while quarto and octavo formats, which were more
economical to print, gained popularity among both printers
and book buyers.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>BINDING TO THE CUSTOMER&rsquo;S ORDER</i></span></h2>
<p>Some idea of the volume of binding done in Hunter&rsquo;s
establishment during the two years covered by his daybook
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
may be gathered from the partial figures for supplies
charged to binding. These included &pound;56 17s. 6d. for paper
and &pound;250 13s. 9&frac12;d. for other binding materials, chiefly calf
and sheepskins, gold leaf, and pasteboard. In physical
quantity the totals are again incomplete but indicative:
at least 140 dozen skins and more than a ton of pasteboard.</p>
<p>These materials, of course, went to the binding of printed
as well as blank books. As their daybooks show, the binding
of books to order was a steady source of income for both
Hunter and Royle&mdash;and doubtless for Royle&rsquo;s successors
as it had been for Hunter&rsquo;s predecessor. Custom work
included the rebinding of worn books, the lettering and
application of title panels, and perhaps some binding of
books the printer bought in flat sheets, already printed,
from London or from another colonial printer.</p>
<p>The fact that custom binding and rebinding accounted
for a prominent share of the work done by Williamsburg
binders indicates that Governor Botetourt was not the only
man in Virginia before the Revolution who owned and
cherished books. According to one estimate, there were at
least 1,000 private libraries with at least 20,000 volumes
altogether before the colony was one hundred years old.
Another study of 100 such collections, including the largest,
calculated their average size at 106 titles (possibly twice
that many volumes).</p>
<p>The average is high because the study included such very
extensive libraries as those of William Byrd II, Robert
Carter, and Ralph Wormeley. Nearly half of the libraries in
the group studied had fewer than twenty-five titles. However,
most Virginia gentlemen of the planter aristocracy
owned at least an armful of books.</p>
<p>An occasional book in any such collection might have
been written by the owner himself. Hunter stitched a
manuscript volume for Nathaniel Walthoe, Esqr., and Royle
bound a handwritten book for John Blair. What these
gentlemen had written that deserved such care can only be
guessed at. Both were officials, so the books might well
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
have been public records of some kind. On the other hand,
perhaps the content was less prosaic: poetry, maybe, or
something like the &ldquo;list of Horse Matches&rdquo; that Royle
bound for the Hon. John Tayloe at two shillings.</p>
<p>Music books, volumes of collected pamphlets and magazines,
a &ldquo;cyphering book&rdquo; for Mrs. Jane Vobe, keeper of
the King&rsquo;s Arms Tavern, and dozens of similar items in
the Hunter and Royle daybooks account for only a portion
of custom binding, however. The book most often bound
to order was the Bible, closely followed by the Anglican
prayer book. Hunter bound a number of Bibles for 6
shillings, but charged 12 shillings for a &ldquo;large Church Bible&rdquo;
and 50 shillings for one &ldquo;neatly bound in Turkey.&rdquo; &ldquo;Turkey,&rdquo;
&ldquo;levant,&rdquo; and &ldquo;morocco&rdquo; leathers were all goatskin,
each taking its name from the region where it was tanned.</p>
<p>Here are a few entries from Royle&rsquo;s daybook during
mid-1765, selected not only because they show the binder&rsquo;s
price list, but also because the customer&rsquo;s name or occupation,
or his preferences in reading matter and binding, or his
concern for the intellectual advancement of the fair sex
may be of interest:</p>

<p>An advertisement Royle placed in the <i>Maryland Gazette</i>
for May 2, 1765, throws an interesting light on one of the
characteristic labor-management difficulties of his time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">WILLIAMSBURG, April 23, 1765</span></p>
<p>Ran away from the Printing-Office, on Saturday Night,
a Servant Man named <i>George Fisher</i>, by Trade a Book-Binder,
between 25 and 26 Years of Age, about 5 feet
5 Inches high, very thick, stoops much, and has a down
Look; he is a little Peck-pitted, has a Scar on one of his
Temples, is much addicted to Licquor, very talkative
when drunk, and remarkably stupid.</p>
<p>Whoever apprehends the said Servant, and conveys
him to the Printing-Office, in Virginia, shall have Five
Pounds Reward, and if taken out of the Colony, TEN
POUNDS, beside what the Law allows.</p>
<p><span class="lr">JOSEPH ROYLE</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems a generous reward indeed for the return of a
man of Fisher&rsquo;s unendearing qualities. Not that Fisher, a
transported convict, was untalented in his way. &ldquo;Conveyed&rdquo;
to Williamsburg and lodged in the gaol, he escaped
at the end of July, both from custody and from history.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>MASS PRODUCTION BY HAND</i></span></h2>
<p>The third principal variety of work done in the Williamsburg
binderies was edition binding&mdash;the stitching and uniform
covering of a whole run of books printed in the same
shop. Session laws of the Virginia Assembly, and periodical
codifications of them printed in editions of 1,000 copies or
more constituted the bulk of edition binding for Parks and
his successors.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death Parks had agreed to print and
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
bind 1,000 copies of the 1748 revision of the Virginia code
&ldquo;with the Arms of Virginia stampt on each book.&rdquo; Along
with the other assets and liabilities of the printing office,
Hunter took over this contract, which called for the volumes
to be finished by June 10, 1751. In October of that year
however, he felt obliged to defend
himself with the following
notice in the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>:</p>
<p>&#9758; The Subscribers to the
<i>Virginia</i> Laws, as well as the
Public Magistrates, having
loudly complain&rsquo;d of their long
Delay, and thrown the Blame
of it entirely on the Printer;
it is judg&rsquo;d necessary to assure
them, That they have been
printed near four Months,
and that their Publication has
been in no wise retarded
through his Neglect, but for
Want of the <i>Table</i>; the Gentleman
appointed to draw it
up, not having yet compleated
it&mdash;&mdash; Those subscribers
who are in immediate Want of
them, on paying a Pistole, may
have them Stitch&rsquo;d for present
Use, which they may afterwards
have bound when the
Table is printed, making it up
the Subscription Price.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="394" height="600" />
<p class="pcap"><i>When he worked on a number of
books at the same time, the binder
ordinarily moved them in groups
through the various binding processes.
Thus a group of books, all damp and
needing to be pressed, could be put
into such a standing press as this, with
&ldquo;press boards&rdquo; between each one.
While this group dried out the next
was being glued up, and so on.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Nearly twenty years later a subsequent collection of
Virginia laws caused a different kind of trouble for three
of Hunter&rsquo;s successors in Williamsburg. The job of printing
and binding 1,000 copies of the great volume was too much
for the public printer, William Rind, to handle alone. So
he undertook it jointly with the partnership of Alexander
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Purdie and John Dixon. Their order for leather to cover
the books was answered by a shipment from London of
&ldquo;Nasty dirty little skins&rdquo; that could neither be used nor
returned. Eventually the skins rotted on the wharf at
Yorktown, while the printers had to ask reimbursement
from the House of Burgesses.</p>
<p>Although William Parks published a number of books
under his own imprint, just as he had done in Annapolis,
Hunter, Royle, and their successors seem to have been much
less active in this phase of the printing and binding business.
Those who were public printers continued to issue the Virginia
laws and other public compilations, proclamations, and
the like. Also, they annually printed small pocket almanacs,
usually only stitched and covered in paper, which sold in
considerable numbers each December and January.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>OTHER WILLIAMSBURG BINDERS</i></span></h2>
<p>The several Williamsburg printers who followed Royle
left no daybooks or other records that have yet come to
light. What little we know of their bookbinding activities
comes from their advertisements in the various <i>Virginia
Gazettes</i>. (At one time three separate weekly papers were
issued in Williamsburg by rival printers, all called the <i>Virginia
Gazette</i>!) Here are some typical samples:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Alexander Purdie and John Dixon, who placed the first of
these advertisements, were the successors of Joseph Royle in
the shop on Duke of Gloucester Street in Williamsburg that
had passed down from William Parks to William Hunter to
Royle to Purdie. Their <i>Virginia Gazette</i> was the direct continuation
of the paper founded by Parks in 1736. We are not
too surprised, therefore, to find the egg roll reappearing once
more on the covers of several copies of a book printed by
Purdie and Dixon in 1774.</p>
<p>The name of Thomas Brend brings to a conclusion the
known list of bookbinders who worked in Williamsburg before
the Revolution. Brend emigrated from England to
Annapolis in 1764 and set up in trade there. It seems
probable that he moved to Williamsburg with William Rind
in 1766 or arrived shortly afterward. Rind was the Annapolis
printer whom Jefferson and some other patriots had
induced to come to Virginia. They hoped Rind&rsquo;s press
would offset the impact of Joseph Royle&rsquo;s, which they
thought was too much in the governor&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>Jefferson was among the men for whom Brend bound
books, as were St. George Tucker of Williamsburg and other
persons less known to history. This work, however, he did
in Richmond, where he moved after the capital of Virginia
had been changed to that city in 1780. There he did most
of his work, including the covers of many books of public
records, as an independent binder.</p>
<p>On an account book of the state auditor for 1785 appears
the familiar egg roll. How it got into Brend&rsquo;s possession no
one can say, since he was presumably not in the direct line
of succession from Parks through Hunter and Royle. Somehow
he did acquire tools from the succession, for the trail of
detection comes full circle in 1799. In that year in Richmond
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Thomas Brend rebound Jefferson&rsquo;s collection of the
laws of Virginia, using to decorate the board edges the same
Mousetrap roll that William Parks had used in Annapolis in
1728.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>THE BINDING OF A BOOK</i></span></h2>
<p>Although this small pamphlet does not pretend to be a
thorough manual on how to bind your own books, anyone
seeking a hobby might well consider bookbinding. The procedures
are simple, the necessary tools and materials need
not cost a great deal, and the satisfactions one can take in
the production of his own fine
bindings should be obvious.</p>
<p>What we can do here is to
describe only the basic tools,
equipment, and procedures
that would have been used
by a Williamsburg craftsman
in binding a book in the most
usual dress of colonial times.
The practicing binder, of
course, would have had a
comparative wealth of tools
and materials with which to
turn out&mdash;by the time-honored
and still-used procedures&mdash;bindings
in greater number
and variety of finish.
The following lists represent
the minimum essentials for binding a book.</p>

<p>The printer&rsquo;s job was done when the flat sheets of paper
came off his press, each sheet containing four or more printed
pages arranged so that folding would bring the pages into
proper sequence. The binder&rsquo;s first task was to fold the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
sheets into &ldquo;signatures&rdquo; of four, eight, twelve, or sixteen
pages.</p>
<p>Sheets folded once&mdash;into two leaves, a four-page signature&mdash;made
a large-format book called a &ldquo;folio.&rdquo; Two folds
in each sheet made eight-page signatures and &ldquo;quarto&rdquo;
books. Three folds gave &ldquo;octavo&rdquo; volumes of sixteen-page
signatures. A different arrangement of folds produced
twelve pages in a signature and a &ldquo;duodecimo&rdquo; book. For
any number of folds, however, a bone or ivory folder&mdash;a
thin, smooth blade&mdash;was essential for rapid and accurate
work. And it came in handy for a number of other binding
operations, too.</p>
<p>After he had folded all the printed sheets, the binder
gathered a full set of signatures in the proper order to make
the book. On his stitching frame&mdash;which was simply a four-piece
vertical framework, the upper crosspiece adjustable in
height&mdash;he stretched four to six leather thongs or pieces of
hemp cord. With needle and strong linen thread he then
stitched the signatures, one after another, through their
center folds to each of the crossbands. The sewing frame
held them parallel to each other and at right angles to the
pages.</p>
<p>These bands gave bound books their flexibility and created
the ridges across the spine characteristic of most of them.
The stitch used in sewing the signatures to the bands was
about as simple as could be, but it cannot be duplicated by
any machine yet devised. The crossbands and the stitching
together were the keys to the all-but-everlasting durability
and the flat opening of the well-made book.</p>
<p>The binder next squared up the back of the book and
applied glue to it. When dry, he put the book in the trimming
press and trimmed the fore edge, head, and tail, then
with his backing hammer rounded off the spine. Having
cut the boards just a bit larger than page size, he punched
holes through them close to their back edges. These holes
he spaced in pairs to match the position of the bands, which
he laced through the holes, pasted firm, and pounded
smooth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Very little the binder had done so far would be visible in
the finished product. But at this point he could begin to
put his artistry on display. Selecting silk thread in two
colors to suit his taste, he bound a narrow piece of leather
across both the top and bottom of the spine, completely
covering them with something like a buttonhole stitch.
These &ldquo;headbands&rdquo; added little to the strength but much
to the appearance of a book.
Careful binders said that a
book should no more be seen
in a library without headbands
than a gentleman
should appear in public
minus a collar.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="501" />
<p class="pcap"><i>In the &ldquo;trimming press and plough,&rdquo;
the bound pages of a book are clamped
between the heavy horizontal beams
of the press while a knife held in the
plough slides back and forth, planing
the exposed edge of the book smooth
and even.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Next came the &ldquo;drawing
on&rdquo; of the cover. The binder
cut a piece of calfskin approximately
&frac34; inch larger
all around than the covers
of the book opened out flat,
and with his skiving knife
pared the margins of the
leather very thin. After the
leather had been well soaked
with water on the outer or
grain side and with paste on
the inner side, the binder
carefully molded it around the spine and smoothed
it onto the boards&mdash;being careful not to stretch it. The
pared margins were then turned in and the volume, except
for minor touches and drying, was finally ready to be decorated.</p>
<p>Having decided on the pattern of decoration he wished to
apply, the binder heated the appropriate brass tools to
&ldquo;blind in&rdquo; the design. The tools had to be hot enough to
make a sharp impression in the leather, but not hot enough
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
to burn it. Each had to be pressed into the leather with
just the right weight&mdash;not too much and not too little&mdash;to
produce the desired effect.</p>
<p>If the pattern was also to be gilded, the binder prepared
a solution of white-of-egg, called &ldquo;glair,&rdquo; and painted it
into the blind impressions. Having laid gold leaf thereon,
he again pressed the same heated tools carefully in the same
indentations. The excess gold was then wiped off and the
leather cleaned with diluted vinegar and dressed with a good
leather dressing.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>This is the Printing Office in Williamsburg, restored to look as it did in the
eighteenth century when it was occupied in succession by William Parks, William
Hunter, Joseph Royle, Alexander Purdie, and John Dixon with his partners William
Hunter, Jr., and Thomas Nicolson.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Finally, the endpapers were pasted down to the insides
of the boards and the book was complete. It took perhaps
eight to ten hours of actual working time for a single volume,
but spaced over as much as two weeks to allow drying time
between processes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>THE WILLIAMSBURG BINDERY TODAY</i></span></h2>
<p>Just as the printing office of William Parks and his successors
stood on Duke of Gloucester Street in Williamsburg
two centuries ago, so it stands again today on its
original site. Again today it includes a bindery where
gentlemen and ladies may bespeak books to be bound or
rebound in the most exact manner and the most elegant
taste. The master binder assures his patrons that he uses
only the best materials and can, if they so wish, decorate a
volume with the egg, the Mousetrap, or any other roll or
ornament in his stock that pleases their fancy.</p>
<p>For he not only uses the same kinds of tools used in the
eighteenth century; some of them are actually recut to produce
replicas of the old patterns. And his methods of work,
too, are the same that were employed in this shop by men
who put sturdy covers on the volumes of William Byrd II,
Thomas Jefferson, and Norborne Berkeley&mdash;otherwise titled
Lord Botetourt.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
